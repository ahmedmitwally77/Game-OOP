I am excited to share my latest project where I combined Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles with API integration to build a dynamic web application. Here are the key features and technologies I used:

1. Project Structure :
 - The web application is divided into two main sections:
 - Games Section : Displays a list of games.
 - Details Section :Shows detailed information about a selected game.

2. Functionality :
 - Upon clicking a game in the Games Section, the Details Section is displayed with the relevant game data.
 - The transition between sections ensures a smooth user experience.

3. API Integration :
 - The application fetches game details from an API using the game's ID.
 - This ensures that the data displayed is always up-to-date and accurate.

4. OOP Implementation :
 - Each section is encapsulated in its own class, promoting code modularity and reusability.
 - A dedicated UI class handles all display-related methods, maintaining a clean separation of concerns.
